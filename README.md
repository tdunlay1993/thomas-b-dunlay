## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
This is a good start in the right direction - just be sure that you have enough detail about your audience to really give you a strong direction design wise. For example - what kind of employers specifically are you interested in applying to? Web Security firms, small dev shops, or corporate or government work, for example. If you wanted to focus on any one or more areas specifically, that might influence how you design and build your site. Chances are you probably have a more general focus, which is OK too. What you have here is sufficient for a decent start. Looking forward to seeing how you would like to feature your music.

Your directory structure is perfect, and your HTML looks great. Nice work. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Beware of leaving empty HTML elements in your files. No biggie - but keep in mind that employers will look at your code.
